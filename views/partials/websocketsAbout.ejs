<h2>What is a web socket?</h2>
<p>
Websocket is an API for sending data back and forth between a client and a server .  Web sockets act much like a regular socket in that it keeps an open connection until terminated by the client or the server.  Websockets can only send and receive two types of data, either data in a Text format or binary data. It is also full-duplex which means that the client and server can be transmit data at the same time.

<h2>How does it compare to other protocols.</h2>
<p>
Websocket differs from other protocols like HTTP1.0 in that websockets are stateful and HTTP is stateless. What this means is that Websockets doesnâ€™t require the server to retain session information. With other HTTP protocols the connection is lost once the transaction ends.
